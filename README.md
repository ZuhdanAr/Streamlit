Mall Customer Clustering Prediction

This project aims to predict clusters among Mall customers based on their age, salary, and score using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The KNN method has been found to be the most effective in this particular case after rigorous testing and evaluation.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of customer information collected from a shopping mall. It includes the following features:

    Age: The age of the customer.
    Salary: The annual income of the customer.
    Score: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior.

Methodology

    Data Exploration: The dataset is analyzed to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the features. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to understand the data.

    Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization if necessary. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for the KNN algorithm.

    Feature Selection: Based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis, the most relevant features are selected for clustering.

    KNN Algorithm: The KNN algorithm is implemented to predict clusters. This algorithm classifies new instances based on the nearest neighbors in the training data. The optimal number of neighbors (K) is determined through experimentation and evaluation.

    Evaluation: The performance of the KNN model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, inertia, or other relevant measures. The results are interpreted to understand the quality and effectiveness of the clustering.

    Visualization: The clusters are visualized using various plotting techniques to gain insights and understand the characteristics of each cluster.

Results

After comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, the KNN method has been determined to be the best approach for predicting clusters among Mall customers based on age, salary, and score. The results demonstrate clear and distinct clusters with meaningful patterns and insights.

The project provides valuable information for the Mall management, enabling targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and enhanced customer segmentation.
